SE tools is a set of tools for Nintendo Switch game memory hacking. 

With SE tools you can search for memory location that will affect the behaviour of the game when modified.
Create cheat codes that modify these memory location. 

SE tools consist of two major components and some optional components.

EdiZon-SE is the memory searching tool. 

Pointersearcher-SE is the pointer searching tool. Many memory locations are dynamic and changes when the game relaunch and some even changes as the game progress. A pointer chain is required to locate these memory locaton. 

Here all the tools I made is package into one release for the latest version of atmosphere.
